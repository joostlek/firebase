# firebase

Create a new Firebase project at firebase.google.com

Go to Databases -> Firestore and activate that

Generate a new Private key at https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?authuser=0, replace Firebase.json with that file

Run it

See, we told you it was easy to setup ;)
